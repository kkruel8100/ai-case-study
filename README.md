# Artificial Intelligence in Finance

## Overview and Origin

### Company Name: 

[Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/)

#### Founded:  

2011

#### Co-founders: 

Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll

#### Backstory:

In Wealthfront's [origin](https://www.wealthfront.com/origin), the backstory of Andy and Dan the co-founders are shared.

After a successful career as co-founder of Benchmark Capital, Andy retired. In retirement, he was continually approached for investing advice. He was unable to share his approach to investing because the entry point for services he used was inaccessible to the average individual. He saw a need for services that could be used by everyone.

In 2008, Dan's parents were negatively impacted by the financial crisis. Because of their financial resources, they didn't have access to the same level of advisory and investment services that high-end investors were able to utilize. He built a prototype that could be used by anyone and receive the same information.

Eventually, their shared visions brought them together and Wealthfront was founded 'to help democratize access to sophisticated financial advice.'

> Per [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wealthfront/company_financials), Wealthfront has raised $274.2 million over 7 rounds of funding with a total of 39 investors.

## Business Activities

#### Solutions:
 
The company is providing high end investment and advisory services to all individuals. Depending on type of account, accounts can be opened with as little as $1 or $500.

#### Target Customers:

The company's intended customer is literally anyone and everyone. More specifically, Wealthfront is geared to individuals wanting to invest but lack the financial net worth to have access to traditional investment services with a higher entry point and services that are tailored to the top percentile client base.

Per [PRNewswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wealthfront-now-oversees-more-than-50-billion-in-client-assets-and-is-on-track-to-grow-revenue-by-over-140-in-2023-301990087.html), Wealthfront has over 700,000 clients with more than $50 billion in assets. Their primary client base is young professionals. 

#### Advantage of Wealthfront over Competitors:

They offer low cost advisory services to individuals, and they are able to offer services that allow customers to save money in fees and taxes while optimizing returns.

## Landscape

#### Field: 

Financial robo-advisory services

#### Robo-Advisor:

From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roboadvisor-roboadviser.asp), Jake Frankenfield defines a robo-advisor as 

> a digital platform that provides automated, algorithm-driven financial planning and investment services with little to no human supervision.

#### Wealthfront Experience:

Wealthfront utilizes AI algoritms to understand clients' risk tolerance and financial goals to determine an optimal diversified portfolio selection that would best balance risk with goal fulfillment. In addition, Wealthfront distinguishes itself from competitors by emphasizing the after-tax returns on investments and applies Tax-Loss Strategy to taxable accounts. Using Weatlhfront software, Tax-Loss Strategy utilizes tax losses to offset taxes and fees while maintaining similar levels of risk and achieve better overall returns compared.

Per [Wealthfront](https://research.wealthfront.com/whitepapers/tax-loss-harvesting/), 

> We find that the median ratio of tax benefit to fee is 4.6x, meaning that for a typical client, our Tax-Loss Harvesting service is paying for itself more than four times over and more than 95% of clients who used Tax-Loss Harvesting received more in tax benefit than they paid in fees.

#### Major Trends:

There is some dispute on the origins of robo-advisory services. [Vanguard](https://institutional.vanguard.com/content/dam/inst/iig-transformation/insights/pdf/Robo-Advisor_Landscape_2023-Vanguard.pdf) credits Financial Engines as the first robo-advisor which was founded in 1996 and utilized computer based asset management. [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364823852_Robo-Advising_Past_Present_and_Future_US_Trends) credits Betterment as the first market advisor in 2010. The key distinction between the two being that Financial Engines was used for clients whereas Betterment was a provider for the masses. 

Using Betterment as the origin for robo-advisory services, the last 10 years has shown advances in algorithms and product offerings. Services now include more investment options, more account options, tax loss harvesting, and hybrid models.   

Future trends in the robo-advisory field include hybrid advisors, advanced features, new players, and consolidation of competitors. Hybrid advisors would utilize the combination of financial advisors and AI tools and allow a more customized and personalized experience. Advanced features would look at adding more investment options and complex tax and retirement planning. Features may also expand to include social and ethical investing and local and regional influence. New players are emerging in the field as more market share is shifting to robo-advisors, so it's likely that banks will become more active in this market. Finally, it's also predicted that many robo-advisory services will merge and consolidate and this may be facilitated with the new players seeking entry by acquiring existing companies rather than by development of new software.

## Recommendations

#### Advice

[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/wealthfront-vs-betterment-4587963) compares Betterment versus Wealthfront. While Wealthfront does receive the overall winning endorsement, the comparisons are very close, and in certain cases, Betterment is recommended over Wealthfront. One key advantage of Betterment over Wealthfront is customer service. To be more competitive, Wealthfront should create a online chatbot to service clients, as well as expanding access to live advisors.

Investopedia identified custodial accounts and mutual funds as services missing from the robo-advisory companies. Adding these types of accounts would give a competitive advantage.

#### Benefits

Ultimately acquiring and maintaining customers revolves around the customer experience. Individuals have come to expect certain features, such as chatbots to solve questions. When the emphasis is on a digital experience and low to no human supervision, it is important to maximize a customer's access to tools and information that will help faciliate decision making as well as improve customer's confidence in their investment advisor of choice.  

By combining an online chatbox and access to additional investment options, Wealthfront has the potential to become the clear leader in the robo-advisory field and gain a leading competitive advantage.

#### Possible Technlogies:

Python

[Per g2](https://www.g2.com/articles/how-to-build-a-chatbot), chatbot platforms to build a bot include:

* IBM Watson Assistant
* TARS
* Amazon Lex
* Verloop
* Chatfuel
* Azure Bot Service
* Collect.chat

#### Technology Selection Criteria:

Those technologies are for chatbots. In addition, [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/top-6-programming-languages-for-chatbot-development/) lists python as the 'preferred language for data projects, machine learning projects, and chatbot projects.'
