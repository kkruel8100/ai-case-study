# Artificial Intelligence in Finance

## Overview and Origin

### Company Name: 

Wealthfront

#### Founded:  

2011

#### Co-founders: 

Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll

#### Backstory:

After a successful career as co-founder of Benchmark Capital, Andy retired. In retirement, he was continually approached for investing advice. He was unable to share his approach to investing because the entry point for services he used was inaccessible to the average individual. He saw a need for services that could be used by everyone.

In 2008, Dan's parents were negatively impacted by the financial crisis. Because of their financial resources, they didn't have access to the same level of advisory and investment services that high-end investors were able to utilize. He built a prototype that could be used by anyone and receive the same information.

Eventually, their shared visions brought them together and Wealthfront was founded 'to help democratize access to sophisticated financial advice.'

* Per Crunchbase, Wealthfront has raised $274.2 million over 7 rounds of funding with a total of 39 investors.

## Business Activities

#### Solutions:
 
The company is providing high end investment and advisory services to all individuals with no minimum fund balances.

#### Target Customers:

Per PRNewswire, Wealthfront has over 700,000 clients with more than $50 billion in assets. Their primary client base is young professionals. 

#### Advantage of Wealthfront over Competitors:

## Landscape

#### Field: 

Financial robo-advisory services

#### Major Trends:

There is some dispute on the origins of robo advisory services. Vanguard credits Financial Engines as the first robo-advisor which was founded in 1996 and utilized computer based asset management. Researchgate credits Betterment as the first market advisor in 2010. The key distinction between the two being that Financial Engines was used for clients whereas Betterment was a provider for the masses. 

Using Betterment as the origin for robo advisory services, the last 10 years has shown advances in algorithms and product offerings. Services now include more investment options, more account options, tax loss harvesting, and hybrid models.   

Future trends in the robo-advisory field include hybrid advisors, advanced features, new players, and consolidation of competitors. Hybrid advisors would utilize the combination of financial advisors and AI tools and allow a more customized and personalized experience. Advanced features would look at adding more investment options and complex tax and retirement planning. Features may also expand to include social and ethical investing and local and regional influence. New players are emerging in the field as more market share is shifting to robo advisors, so it's likely that banks will become more active in this market. Finally, it's also predicted that many robo advisory services will merge and consolidate and this may be facilitated with the new players seeking entry by acquiring existing companies rather than by development of new software.

#### Competitors:
Betterment, Vanguard, and Schwab

## Recommendations

#### Advice

One key advantage of Betterment over Wealthfront is customer service. To be more competitive, Wealthfront should create a online chatbot to service clients, as well as expanding access to live advisors.

Custodial accounts and mutual funds are services missing from the robo advisory companies. Adding these types of accounts would give a competitive advantage.

#### Benefits

Ultimately acquiring and maintaining customers revolves around the customer experience. Individuals have come to expect certain features, such as chatbots to solve questions. Plus, when a company is trying to be the financial advisor, customers gain a comfort level with their money when they have access to real live individuals.  

#### Possible Technlogies:

Python

Per g2, chatbot platforms to build a bot include:

* IBM Watson Assistant
* TARS
* Amazon Lex
* Verloop
* Chatfuel
* Azure Bot Service
* Collect.chat

#### Technology Selection Criteria:

Those technologies are for chatbots. In addition, codecademy lists python as the 'preferred language for data projects, machine learning projects, and chatbot projects.'
